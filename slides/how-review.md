##  Review

Notes:
# Document 
- Document! create a "Brag Book", Portfolio, Body of Work .. use a company template if you have one, but if you don't that's ok. It's the content that matters.
- Look for examples that highlight the work that you did that speak for themselves as much as possible and that are as obejctive as possible. 
- roll completed accomplishments and how you developed into the artifact you are using
- DO - capture details for your brag book to outline what you did!
- DO *NOT* : Exfiltrate company data that gets you fired in the process 
## Example
- "I *led* the *deisgn* of the doof system and here are the _links_ to the design documents and pull requests that outline my leadership of the effort
## BONUS POINTS
- The implmentation of the Doof system allowed us to onboard new engineers to the company at a 3x rate.
