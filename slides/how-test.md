Notes: 
# Get Feedback 
- get feedback along the way from your support group (manager, mentor, coach, peers) and make adjustments where necessary on your approach(es)
- setup regular mechanisms to get feedback and input (once a year is NOT ok)
- doesnt' have to be formal or a meeting - but having a scheduled cadenace with your manager is something you should do.
