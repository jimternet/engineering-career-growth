##  Planning - Introspection

Notes: 
1. Where do you want to go? E.g. do you want to be an engineer? a manager? 
1. If you've considered this before, has anything changed? Do you want to change paths? (That's OK!)
2. What are the expectations of the role you are aspriing to? Does your company have a clear Roles and Responsibilites (RoR) outline? (if not you can find one that speaks to you online)
2. Evaluate yourself with the RoR you are using :
    - What are you good at now? 
    - Where do you have opprotunities? (what are you bad at or have you just not had a chance to develop in yet?) 
    - What are you "OK" at that you need to hone to show your ready for that promotion?
